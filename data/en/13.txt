“Mew! Mew!” interrupted Simpkin, and he scratched at the door. But the key was under the tailor’s pillow, he could not get in.
The little mice only laughed, and tried another tune —
“Three little mice sat down to spin,Pussy passed by and she peeped in.What are you at, my fine little men?Making coats for gentlemen.Shall I come in and cut off your threads?Oh, no, Miss Pussy, you’d bite off our heads!”
“Mew! Mew!” cried Simpkin. “Hey diddle dinketty?” answered the little mice —
“Hey diddle dinketty, poppetty pet!The merchants of London they wear scarlet;Silk in the collar, and gold in the hem,So merrily march the merchantmen!”
They clicked their thimbles to mark the time, but none of the songs pleased Simpkin; he sniffed and mewed at the door of the shop.
“And then I boughtA pipkin and a popkin,A slipkin and a slopkin,All for one farthing ——
and upon the kitchen dresser!” added the rude little mice.
“Mew! scratch! scratch!” scuffled Simpkin on the window-sill; while the little mice inside sprang to their feet, and all began to shout at once in little twittering voices: “No more twist! No more twist!” And they barred up the window shutters and shut out Simpkin.
But still through the nicks in the shutters he could hear the click of thimbles, and little mouse voices singing —
“No more twist! No more twist!”
Simpkin came away from the shop and went home, considering in his mind. He found the poor old tailor without fever, sleeping peacefully.
